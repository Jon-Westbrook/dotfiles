Linter configurations and tools for development via Sublime Text 3, SublimeLinter, Node and NPM. 

To use, install Package Control for Sublime Text 3, and then install SublimeLinter. Make sure you have Node NPM installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can then optionally install the following SublimeLinter plugins via the command line: 

a) SublimeLinter-csslint
b) JSBeautify
c) HTML-Tidy
d) SASS-Lint

Be sure to follow the specific installation instructions for each optional plugin. 

Create an alias to each individual config file, and place it where you keep all of your web development project folders.
